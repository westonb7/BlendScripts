# BlendScripts

Here's just a quick sample script for running a blending function and plotting it using matplotlib, in a jupyter notebook.

## Prerequisites

This will require python3, jupyter, and matplotlib to be installed. It will also require numpy, but numpy should be auto-installed when mmatplotlib is.

## Running the script from jupyter

Anaconda can be used to view jupyter notebooks, but isn't necessary. You can view this script by navigating to the directory in your terminal, and running the command:

`jupyter notebook blendTesting.ipynb`

This should open the jupyter notebook in your browser if everything worked correctly. Each of the cells in the notebook can be run using the `shift + return` keyboard shortcut, or clicking the 'run cell' button.

# BlendScripts

Here's a few sample scripts for running some blending functions and plotting them using matplotlib, in a jupyter notebook.

## Prerequisites

This will require python3, jupyter, and matplotlib to be installed. It will also require numpy, but numpy should be auto-installed when matplotlib is. Some later scripts may require a few additional libraries, as I add more scripts with more complex graphing and functionality.

## Running the script from jupyter

Anaconda can be used to view jupyter notebooks, but isn't necessary. You can view this script by navigating to the directory in your terminal, and running the command:

`jupyter notebook blendSample.ipynb`

This should open the jupyter notebook in your browser if everything worked correctly. Each of the cells in the notebook can be run using the `shift + return` keyboard shortcut, or clicking the 'run cell' button.

## Viewing the jupyter notebook from browser

The jupyter notebook files here can all be viewed in a browser by navigating to the github page where each notebook is hosted. This should display all the code and images in the notebook without the need to install jupyter or any other packages. Note that if animated images are generated in this way, they cannot be viewed in-browser.
